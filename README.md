# Political-Quiz-Generator
#### Allows user to add questions and fine-tune weightings of questions, which can be adapted to any four-quadrant alignment question-set. Made this for a friend's website.
#### My second stab at JS! Would've done a lot differently, including avoiding over-modularizing the js files.

# How to use
Modify/add questions to the questions.js file. Instructions for fine-tuning answer weightings are provided in the comments.

To run, add questions and open the html file.

For use with a currently existing site, add the html file to your site and if needed, modify the script sources add the bottom. The unmodified setup assumes that a js folder exists in the same directory as the html file.

This version relies on a Bootstrap CDN but you can easily go without it.
